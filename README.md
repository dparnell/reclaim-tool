# About
This project connects to the Amazon public IOT services to subscribe to the data generated by a WiFi enabled Reclaim Energy heat pump controller.

# Interface

This command line tool has functions to fetch a private key and certificate for a cognito-identity from Amazon.
The key and certificate are saved to `~/.config/reclaim/` as `private.pem` and `certificate.pem` and `certicicate.pem` respectively.
The certificate and key are then used to connect to the AWS IOT service.
Command line options exist to specify the AWS region, IOT endpoint and identity pool id.

The tool can be used to subscribe to the MQTT topic `dontek{hexid}/status/psw` (where hexid is the 17 digit unique identifier of the Reclaim Enegery heat pump) and print the data received.
